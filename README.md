They are useful when orders are fulfilled in some other external system. When `externalFulfillment` is set to `true`, Ecwid will hide fulfillment status controls and ability to ship / set tracking number for an order. [Learn more](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/orders)

## Aug 6, 2019

2) You can now send multiple requests at once to create or update products in [Ecwid REST API](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/products). Earlier, it was only possible to do it concecutively – one after another. However, you should still respect the [Ecwid REST API limits](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/rest-api-reference#api-calls-limits) when making your requests. 

## April 18, 2019

Updated the [Ecwid CSS Framework](https://developers.ecwid.com/ecwid-css-framework) to `1.3.6` version.

1) Added support to disable email notifications to customers for specific orders in REST API. See the `disableAllCustomerNotifications` field in [orders endpoint](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/orders).

- product names 
- product descriptions

- product option values (choices)
- category name
- category description

The old fields remain the same, but the new ones have `Translated` suffix. I.e. `titleTranslated`, `descriptionTranslated` and so on. [Learn more](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/rest-api-reference)

P.S. if you can't see fields for translations, go to Ecwid Control Panel > Settings > What's new and make sure you've enabled the new feature for your store.

## April 12, 2019

1) Added support for several structured data fields for [static product pages](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/static-store-pages#get-product-page): 

- Brand
- MPN

2) Added field for tracking referals for each order – `refererId`. 

It is available for [REST API](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/orders), CSV order export, email notifications and invoices, and [in storefront](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/manage-customer-cart#set-order-referrer). 

## Mar 22, 2019

This can be useful if you use a sticky header on your website that stays displayed when users scroll down website pages. [Learn more](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/customize-behaviour#offset-default-storefront-scroll-position)

## Mar 18, 2019

Added new tools to track customers who agreed to receive email promotions. 

`acceptMarketing` field: for the [Orders](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/orders) and [Customers](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/customers) REST API endpoints. 

If `acceptMarketing` is `false` – you can't use email of this customer for promotions. If `acceptMarketing` is `true` or `null` – you can send promotional emails to that customer. 

`showAcceptMarketingCheckbox`, `acceptMarketingCheckboxDefaultValue`, `acceptMarketingCheckboxCustomText` for the [Store profile](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/store-information) REST API endpoint.

## Mar 15, 2019

- [Public app config](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/public-application-config) size was increased from 64Kb to **256Kb**. 

- Clarified how `quantity` field works when getting product variations from products and variations endpoints. If `sku` is omitted for variation, then `quantity` is nested from base product. If `sku` is present, the variation has its own quantity value.

## Feb 14, 2019

Added `DEFINED_BY_STORE_OWNER` sort method for [searching products](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/products#search-products) in Ecwid REST API. 

If request is applicable to a specific category (i.e. `category` is set), then `DEFINED_BY_STORE_OWNER` sort method is used. Otherwise, when results are not related to a specific category, `RELEVANCE` sort method is used.

## Feb 5, 2019

We added new feature to Ecwid – **Product Filters**. It can help customers to find products easier when there are many products to choose from. 

- [Product Filters in Ecwid Help Center](https://support.ecwid.com/hc/en-us/articles/207807925)
- [Product filters in Ecwid API Documentation](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/product-filters)

## Jan 31, 2019

We updated behaviour of `url` field for getting products via REST API. 

Now, if Ecwid knows that this store uses [SEO-friendly URLs](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/seo#seo-friendly-urls), then the API will return URLs in that format by default. 

If it doesn't happen for your store, you can still get product URLs in a clean URL format. See the [getting product URLs](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/products#q-how-to-get-urls-for-products) section.

## Jan 24, 2019

We updated our webhook retry policy. 

Earlier, if Ecwid couldn't deliver a webhook to an app's URL, it would retry sending it every 15 minutes for 48 hours. 

Now, if webhook delivery fails 1st time, Ecwid will re-send a webhook every 15 minutes for 4 more tries. 

If Ecwid still can't deliver the webhook after that, it will try sending webhooks every 60 minutes until 24 hour limit is reached. 

Once the 24 hour limit is reached, the webhook will be removed from the queue and will not be sent again.

## December 26, 2018

Shipping apps can now provide custom description for their shipping methods displayed at checkout. 

Use the new field `description` when returning shipping rates back to Ecwid when customer is at checkout. 

**Important**: for new Ecwid accounts, we do not use the `transitDays` field. So make sure to update your app to provide `description` field as well as `transitDays` so both old and new users can see the estimates.

[Add Shipping Method Documentation](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/add-shipping-method)

## December 25, 2018

1) Improved the flow of working with product images. Now all images (main image and gallery images) are contained within the same field – `media`. 

You are able to get their URLs and sort them the way you need with appropriate fields. To set an existing image as main product image, update its `isMain` field to `true`.

All existing fields (`galleryImages`, `imageUrl`, etc.) are still provided in the API, but they are now deprecated in the documentation. 

[Learn more](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/products)

2) Added `lastUpdated` field to static pages endpoint response. It represents a UNIX timestamp of when the response data was generated. 

[Learn more](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/static-store-pages)

## December 24, 2018

We updated the order search filters in the [Ecwid REST API](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/orders#search-orders) in regards to customer details. 

We added two new fields: `email` and `customerId`. They return orders accordingly – for the email or customer ID used to place an order. 

The `customer` field has been deprecated from docs, but it still works in the API itself for now. In your solutions, make sure to use the new fields instead. 

## December 3, 2018

## October 10, 2018

Added `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header support for the Ecwid REST API requests.

You can use this optional header to get responses from the Ecwid REST API quicker. This header tells Ecwid to provide compressed version of the response, thus it improves the speed of the responses. 

Use it to make 'heavy' requests like getting all products or orders from a store. 

## October 4, 2018

Available date formats for the REST API were changed in the documentation to only include UNIX Timestamp format – for ease of access and understanding. 

**The old formats still work and are available – no need to update your custom solutions / public applications.**

This change is only for the documentation and we do not plan to change the date format support in the REST API itself in the future.

## September 21, 2018

## June 29, 2018

Added new application type for discount coupons – new customers only. It allows merchants to send out coupons that only work for new customers. 

With this change we are deprecating the `repeatCustomerOnly` field for discount coupons, replacing it with `applicationLimit` with these possible values: `"UNLIMITED"`, `"NEW_CUSTOMER_ONLY"`, `"REPEAT_CUSTOMER_ONLY"`.

If you are creating or updating a discount coupon, make sure to use the old `repeatCustomerOnly` field or the new `applicationLimit` field **only**.

In a situation where both these fields are sent, the priority will be given to the new field – `applicationLimit`.
