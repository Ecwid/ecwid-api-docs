The Ecwid API allows your application to be embedded right into the user Control Panel and work like it is built into Ecwid. 

Overall, it works this way:

- The user installs the application and allows it to add a new tab to the Ecwid Control Panel.
- After installation, a new tab shows the page content of your specified IFRAME URL.
- Ecwid provides a [REST API](#rest-api-reference) and a [JS SDK](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/ecwid-javascript-sdk#ecwid-javascript-sdk) for authentication and operations inside of the Ecwid Control Panel.

Although this approach is not necessary and you can use the Ecwid API without embedding an application into the Control Panel, we highly recommend it. Being integrated with Ecwid this way, your app will get way more user engagement, as it will be a part of a merchant store backend.

## Building a native app

### Set up your application

After the app registration you will need to provide us with additional details about your app interface in the Ecwid Control Panel. 

These details are necessary to properly show your page, please see the required details below:

Parameter | Meaning
--------- | -------
Iframe URL | This is a <strong>HTTPS URL</strong> of the application page hosted on your server, which will be loaded in Ecwid Control panel. Requirements: <ul><li>It must load over <strong>HTTPS</strong></li> <li>The page must not contain header/footer, i.e. you will need to design this page as an embeddable, not as a standalone application.</li><li>The page must be mobile-ready for cases when store owners go to Ecwid Control Panel on mobile devices.</li><li>The page content should not contain the word 'Ecwid', so we can offer your app to our partners</li><li>Its interface must use [Ecwid CSS Framework](#ecwid-css-framework)</li><li>The page must <a href="https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/ecwid-javascript-sdk#init">initialize the app</a> using Ecwid Javascript SDK to be displayed</li></ul>
App page title | This will be the title of the tab in Ecwid control panel where your application resides. Please keep it short as it will reside in a row of native Ecwid tabs and other applications 
Control panel section | The section of Ecwid control panel where you want your application to be added. Supported sections: <ul><li>*Sales* – choose this if your application works with orders or customers</li> <li>*Catalog* – choose this if your application works with products, variations, product images etc. </li> <li>*Discounts* – this section is for the applications working with discounts, coupons, loyalty programs and other promotion features</li> <li>*Settings* – you can choose this section if you need to place your application settings at the same level as the store settings</li><li>*Reports* - choose this section if your app shows store statistics</li><li>*Sales Channels* - choose this section if your app adds another sales channel for a store</li></ul>

    // Get the store ID and access token
    var storeData = EcwidApp.getPayload();
    var storeId = storeData.store_id;
    var accessToken = storeData.access_token;
    var language = storeData.lang;

    if (storeData.public_token !== undefined){
      var publicToken = storeData.public_token;
    }
    
    if (storeData.app_state !== undefined){
      var appState = storeData.app_state;
    }

    // do something...
  </script>

```

Here you can find a starter template that you can use as a skeleton of your own application.

#### Notes

* The `EcwidApp.init()` method initializes the application within Ecwid Control panel and allows it to show the page content
* The `EcwidApp.getPayload()` method allows you to get the Store ID and REST API access token. See details in the further sections
* Ecwid will load your app's *Iframe URL* with a payload to help identify the merchant's store. To find out more about the store authentication process in the app tab, see the [Authentication section](#authentication-in-embedded-apps).
* See the detailed description of the `init()` and `getPayload()` functions here: [Ecwid JS SDK](#ecwid-javascript-sdk).

Full native application source code example for Custom URL for "Thank you" page app from [the Ecwid App Market](https://www.ecwid.com/apps/customizestorefront/custom-thank-you) is available here: [https://github.com/Ecwid/custom-thank-you-page-app](https://github.com/Ecwid/custom-thank-you-page-app)

A sample native application with examples of how to access Ecwid REST API, save data to application storage and how to design the app is available here: [https://github.com/Ecwid/sample-native-app](https://github.com/Ecwid/sample-native-app)

<aside class="note">
If your app for public use, it is required to use <a href='https://github.com/Ecwid/sample-native-app'>Sample Native App</a> interface for its user interface. 
</aside>

Also, see the [set up your application](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/building-an-embedded-app#set-up-your-application) and [Native Apps Guideline](/native-applications) to find out how this page should work.


#### Q: What is my app_id?

When user opens the application tab, the browser's address bar URL will have a format like this: 

`https://my.ecwid.com/cp/#app:name=my-cool-app&parent-menu=sales&app_state=orderId%3A%2012`

Where the `my-cool-app` is your **app_id** which you will need to use in this code template to initiale the application on the page. The `sales` part is the Ecwid Control Panel section where the app is embedded into.

#### Q: Do I need to use Ecwid styles for my app? 

Native apps become a part of an Ecwid Control Panel, hence they need to look like a part of it. You can use Ecwid CSS Framework to achieve it in your app. 

Ecwid CSS Framework allows you to create interface faster and easier. If your application is a custom solution for your own store, we still recommend using the Ecwid styles, but it's not mandatory. 

### Native interface translations

You are able to translate native application interface based on the language of Ecwid Control Panel. 

The current language of Ecwid Control Panel is provided in the authentication payload your application receives.

[Authentication Payload](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/authentication-in-embedded-apps#app-authentication) can be sent in two modes: 

- client-side (via hash `#`)
- server-side (URL query string: `?` and `&`)

**Use these steps to translate your Native app**: 

1. Find out how your app gets the payload (check your app iframe URL in browser's dev tools)
2. Get `lang` field value from the payload
3. Load the interface based on that value

If the current language is not supported, use the fallback labels. For example, load English texts if user is Spanish and you don't have Spanish translations yet. 

More info on getting and parsing authentication payload: [https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/authentication-in-embedded-apps#app-authentication](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/authentication-in-embedded-apps#app-authentication)

## Deep linking

Native apps in Ecwid Control Panel support deep linking, which means that they can receive information prior to being loaded and opened. This can provide your app with a new level of interactivity with a user by reacting to the context, sent to your app.

This functionality is achieved by passing a URL-encoded value - `app_state` to your application prior to loading and opening it for a user. 

### Sending app state

A typical native application URL looks like this: `https://my.ecwid.com/cp/CP.html#app:name=my-cool-app&parent-menu=sales`

In case of your app being called using deep linking, that URL will also have a new parameter - `app_state` :

`https://my.ecwid.com/cp/#app:name=my-cool-app&app_state=orderId%3A%2012`

The `app_state` parameter value is a URL encoded string with a specific application state your app can understand and process. 

### Receiving app state

Receiving and processing the externally called app state depends on the type of user authentication you are using. See the details below. 

**Default user authentication**

> Default user authentication

```
GET https://www.example.com/my-app-iframe-page#53035362c226163636573735f746f6b656e223a22776d6
```

```js
{
  "store_id": 1003,
  "lang": "en",
  "access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "app_state":"orderId%3A%2012",
  "public_token":"public_QnWFi7GpGemRUvz3SJ18crtJ5ru8yjfy"
}
```

> Get app state with Ecwid JS SDK

```js
  var storeData = EcwidApp.getPayload();
  var storeId = storeData.store_id;
  var accessToken = storeData.access_token;
  var language = storeData.lang;

  if (storeData.public_token !== undefined){
    var publicToken = storeData.public_token;
  }

  if (storeData.app_state !== undefined){
    var appState = storeData.app_state;
  }
...
```

When using default user authentication, the app state will be delivered through the Ecwid JavaScript SDK in the `EcwidApp.getPayload()` method.

Once it's called, you can save the user details and app state into your client-side variables. See example on the right.

Learn more about [Default User Authentication](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/authentication-in-embedded-apps#default-user-auth)

**Enhanced security user authentication**

> Enhanced security user authentication

```
GET https://www.example.com/my-app-iframe-page?payload=353035362c226163636573735f746f6b656e223a22776d6&app_state=orderId%3A%2012&cache-killer=13532
```

> Get app state from GET parameter

```php
  // URL Encoded App state passed to the app
  if (isset($_GET['app_state'])){
    $app_state = $_GET['app_state'];
  }
```

When using enhanced security user authentication, the app state will be delivered as a GET parameter `app_state` of your iframe URL alongside the standard parameters.

You can retrieve it just like any other value of a GET parameter on a server-side and then save and use it in your app code. See example on the right.

Learn more about [Enhanced Security User Authentication](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/authentication-in-native-apps#enhanced-security-user-auth)

## Authentication in native apps

### User authentication

In your application, you will likely show some user-specific data, for example the store order list. To do that, your iframe application will need to know:

* The ID of the store using your application at the moment
* The token that allows to access the store data
* The language of the Ecwid Control Panel
* Optional application state to initialize the app with

Ecwid will pass this data to your application as soon as it is opened in Ecwid Control panel. The way data is passed to your application and the way you should decrypt the received data depends on whether you process it on a client or a server side of your application. 

Below, you will find the description of a default user authentication for native applications.

#### Default User Authentication

In the default user auth process, Ecwid will call your iframe URL like this: 

`https://www.example.com/my-app-iframe-page#53035362c226163636573735f746f6b656e223a22776d6`

This process allows for simple user authentication in your app using the **Ecwid JS SDK**.

[Continue with default authentication](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/authentication-in-native-apps#default-user-auth)

#### Enhanced Security User Authentication

In the enhanced security auth process, Ecwid will call your iframe URL like this:

`https://www.example.com/my-app-iframe-page?payload=353035362c226163636573735f746f6b656e223a22776d6&app_state=orderId%3A%2012&cache-killer=13532`

We recommend using this type of authentication for complex applications that can modify parts of a store and require additional security measures.

[Continue with enhanced security authentication](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/authentication-in-native-apps#enhanced-security-user-auth)

<aside class="note">By default, Ecwid uses <strong>Default User Authentication</strong> process so you can start working on your application's tab right away without using server side. If you need your app to be switched to <strong>Enhanced Security User Authentication</strong>, please <a href='/contact'>contact us</a> and we will update your app.</aside>

### App authentication

After your app authorized a user, it will need an **access token** to the Ecwid REST API to read and modify Ecwid store orders, products and other information. 

The process of getting the access token is different for each user authentication type. Both authentication processes are described below, so please check them out for more info on getting access tokens.

```

> Workflow of client-side applications

```js
//
//  Get store details
//
    var storeData = EcwidApp.getPayload();
    var storeId = storeData.store_id;
    var accessToken = storeData.access_token;
    var language = storeData.lang;
    var viewMode = storeData.view_mode;
    
    if (storeData.public_token !== undefined){
      var publicToken = storeData.public_token;
    }
    
    if (storeData.app_state !== undefined){
      var appState = storeData.app_state;
    }

//
//  Get store specific data
//

    var backgroundColor;
    EcwidApp.getAppStorage('color', function(value) {
      if (value !== null) {
        // set user color from storage
        backgroundColor = value;
      } else {
        // set default color
        backgrountColor = 'black';
      } 
    });

//
//  Start the flow of your application
//  ...
```

Ecwid allows your application to fully reside on client side and not use server side at all. So you can authenticate the user, get store ID and access token, and manage the store data via Ecwid API right inside your app in Control panel without calling your server scripts. 

By default, all applications are registered as client-side so you can start working on your application's tab right away without using server side. 

The workflow can be described into the following steps: 

1. Get store preferences and data
2. Initialize your application functionality

#### 1. Get store preferences and data

For convenience, we provide a simple Javascript SDK that you can use in your application to authenticate the user and get access to the API. As soon as the JS SDK script is used, you can call the provided `EcwidApp.getPayload()` method to retrieve the user's store ID and access token as shown in example. See also [.getPayload()](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/ecwid-javascript-sdk#getpayload) method specification. So, in your application code, you will need to include Ecwid JS SDK script and use provided methods to authenticate the user as shown in the example. 

If your application is going to store some user specified information, like background color, page IDs or something else, you can use [Ecwid Javascript SDK](#ecwid-javascript-sdk) to access [Storage endpoint](#application-storage) to easily store and access this data there without saving this information on your server.

See functions `EcwidApp.getAppStorage`, `EcwidApp.setAppStorage` and `EcwidApp.setAppPublicConfig` in [Ecwid Javascript SDK](#ecwid-javascript-sdk) for more details.

#### 2. Initialize your application functionality

So once you know the store you are working with and you have the settings and other data specific to that store, you can use that information in your native application to start is stndard workflow.

### Enhanced Security User Auth

By default, all applications are registered as **client-side** so you can start working on your application's tab right away without using server side. If you need your app to be switched to server-side, please [contact us](/contact) and we will update your app.

The workflow of such applications can be divided into several steps: 

1. Decrypt the payload from the Ecwid Control Panel
2. Get store specific data (optional)
3. Initialize your application functionality

So let's look a little closer on how to create a your native server-side application:

#### 1. Decrypt the payload from the Ecwid Control Panel

Let's say, you process user input and prepare the data to display in your app on your server and then pass this information to your application UI to be displayed in the user Control panel. 

In this case, you will need to authenticate user on server side of your application. Ecwid sends an auth data to your app in a payload while requesting your iframe URL as follows: 

`https://www.example.com/my-app-iframe-page?payload={payload}&app_state={app_state}&cache-killer={cache-killer}`

By default, all applications are registered as client-side so you can start working on your application's tab right away without using server side. If you need your app to be switched to server-side to have the URL called as mentioned above, please contact us and we will update your app.

> Example of the iframe URL call in server-side apps

```


> Workflow of server-side applications

```php
<?php
//
//  Get and decrypt the payload from Ecwid

function getEcwidPayload($app_secret_key, $data) {
  // Get the encryption key (16 first bytes of the app's client_secret key)
  $encryption_key = substr($app_secret_key, 0, 16);

  // Decrypt payload
  $json_data = aes_128_decrypt($encryption_key, $data);

  // Decode json
  $json_decoded = json_decode($json_data, true);
  return $json_decoded;
}

function aes_128_decrypt($key, $data) {
  // Ecwid sends data in url-safe base64. Convert the raw data to the original base64 first
  $base64_original = str_replace(array('-', '_'), array('+', '/'), $data);

  // Get binary data
  $decoded = base64_decode($base64_original);

  // Initialization vector is the first 16 bytes of the received data
  $iv = substr($decoded, 0, 16);

  // The payload itself is is the rest of the received data
  $payload = substr($decoded, 16);

  // Decrypt raw binary payload
  $json = openssl_decrypt($payload, "aes-128-cbc", $key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv);
  //$json = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $payload, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv); // You can use this instead of openssl_decrupt, if mcrypt is enabled in your system

  return $json;
}

// Get payload from the GET and process it
$ecwid_payload = $_GET['payload'];
$client_secret = "0123abcd4567efgh1234567890"; // this is a dummy value. Please place your app secret key here
$result = getEcwidPayload($client_secret, $ecwid_payload);

// Get store info from the payload
$token = $result['access_token'];
$storeId = $result['store_id'];
$lang = $result['lang'];
$viewMode = $result['view_mode'];

if (isset($result['public_token'])){
  $public_token = $result['public_token'];
}

> Example of decrypted payload

```json
{
  "store_id": 1003,
  "lang": "en",
  "access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "view_mode":"PAGE",
  "public_token":"public_ASDlkDASmasdaslkdASkndasANJKLsAf"
}
```

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
payload | string | Encrypted JSON string containing the authentication information (see the details below)
cache-killer | string | Random string preventing caching on your server
app_state | string | Optional **URL Encoded** app state passed to the app in the URL

#### Payload

The payload parameter is encrypted JSON string, which, when decrypted, has the following format:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
store_id | number | Ecwid store ID
lang | string | User language (which is currently set in their Control Panel). Use this parameter to translate your application UI to the user language.
access_token | string | Secure oAuth token for Ecwid REST API
public_token | string | Public oAuth token for Ecwid REST API
view_mode | string | Mode used to display the application interface: in a `POPUP` or in a `PAGE`. `PAGE` is a default mode when app is displayed in a separate tab in Ecwid Control Panel

#### Decryption of payload on your server

Ecwid uses *AES-128* to encrypt the payload. The key is the first 16 symbols (128 bit) of your application secret key (**client_secret**). It is provided when you register an app with us. See a PHP example of decryption to get better idea on how to receive and decrypt the payload.

#### 2. Get store preferences and data

Now that you have successfully got store details and have access to it using Ecwid API, you can get store-specific information from the storage endpoint or from your local database. 

The result of the payload decryption will be provided in an array `$result`, which you can use to get store ID, access token and language information about a store, that opened your app tab in Ecwid control panel.

To store and get store-specific data in storage endpoint, you can use cURL functionality in PHP or any other way that you prefer to access REST API endpoints. You can see the example code on how to retrieve the value of `'color'` key in application storage using cURL and process the result on the right based on a response from API.

#### 3. Initialize your application functionality

Once you got all details that you need, you can start the standard planned workflow for your app and operate with Ecwid API using the details you got earlier.

## Ecwid CSS Framework

[Go to the CSS framework documentation →](/ecwid-css-framework)

We provide a set of ready UI components in a form of CSS framework to help you easily design your application embedded into Ecwid Control Panel. The framework includes buttons, links, messages, forms in a nice and consistent design. 

#### How to use it?

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://djqizrxa6f10j.cloudfront.net/ecwid-sdk/css/1.3.1/ecwid-app-ui.css"/>
</head>

<body>
  
  <div>Some content</div>

  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://djqizrxa6f10j.cloudfront.net/ecwid-sdk/css/1.3.1/ecwid-app-ui.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

1) Add this CSS file to your native app: 
`https://djqizrxa6f10j.cloudfront.net/ecwid-sdk/css/1.3.1/ecwid-app-ui.css`

2) Add this JS file at before closing the BODY tag: 
`https://djqizrxa6f10j.cloudfront.net/ecwid-sdk/css/1.3.1/ecwid-app-ui.min.js`

3) Use this guide to find the elements and CSS classes you need: [http://developers.ecwid.com/ecwid-css-framework/](/ecwid-css-framework)

<aside class="note">If some elements don't apply correct styles, make sure to add <strong><em>.normalized</em></strong> class to the <em>body</em> or any other top DOM element of your application page in Ecwid Control Panel to fix this.</aside>

<img src="https://dj925myfyz5v.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/ecwid-buttons.png"></img>


## Ecwid Javascript SDK

```html
<!-- Include Ecwid JS SDK -->
<script src="https://djqizrxa6f10j.cloudfront.net/ecwid-sdk/js/1.2.5/ecwid-app.js"></script>
```

Ecwid Javascript SDK is a simple JS framework with a set of basic JS functions that will help you to embed your app to Ecwid Control Panel and interact with Ecwid from within your application.

To use the SDK, include this file into your app: `https://djqizrxa6f10j.cloudfront.net/ecwid-sdk/js/1.2.5/ecwid-app.js` .

### init

> Example of using EcwidApp.init() method

```js
// Initialize the application
EcwidApp.init({
  app_id: "my-super-app", // use your application client_id
  autoloadedflag: true, 
  autoheight: true
});
```

The `EcwidApp.init()` method initializes your app inside Ecwid Control Panel. Call it once at the beginning of executable code in your app.

You can get the `app_id` using the URL in your browser when you open your application tab. Here's a typical link that you can get when you open your app: `https://my.ecwid.com/cp/CP.html#app:name=my-super-app&parent-menu=promotions`

The `app_id` here is the `my-super-app` part. Make sure to use this to initialize your application with Ecwid JS SDK.

#### Parameters

The only parameter is a JS object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
**app_id** | string | Namespace of your application (as set in the application settings)
autoloadedflag | boolean | Define how Ecwid should detect when your app is loaded. Set as `true`, if you want Ecwid to automatically detect the fact that you your app is loaded. Ecwid uses the window.onload event of your application document. If you want to contol when Ecwid should start displaying your app and inform it of your app's ready state, you should set this flag as `false` and use the [`EcwidApp.ready()`](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/ecwid-javascript-sdk#ready) method. As soon as the app is loaded, Ecwid hides the 'Loading' animation and shows the app content.
autoheight | boolean | Set as `true` if you want Ecwid to dynamically adjust your app iframe height depending on your app content. If you want to control the iframe size yourself, set this flag as `false` and use the [`EcwidApp.setSize()`](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/ecwid-javascript-sdk#setsize) method.


### getPayload

> Retrieving store ID and access token using Ecwid JavaScript SDK 

```js
    var storeData = EcwidApp.getPayload();
    var storeId = storeData.store_id;
    var accessToken = storeData.access_token;
    var language = storeData.lang;
    var viewMode = storeData.view_mode;

    if (storeData.public_token !== undefined){
      var publicToken = storeData.public_token;
    }
    
    if (storeData.app_state !== undefined){
      var appState = storeData.app_state;
    }

    // now you know the user you interact with and can access Ecwid API on their behalf
```

`EcwidApp.getPayload()`

Above, we explained how your app can be a client-side HTML/JS application and still access Ecwid API right from Ecwid Control Panel (see [Authentication in native apps](#authentication-in-native-apps) section). There, we used the `EcwidApp.getPayload()` method to get the store ID and API access token. 

The payload is a JSON with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
**store_id** | number | Ecwid store ID
**lang** | string | User language (which is currently set in their Control Panel). Use this parameter to translate your application UI to the user language.
**access_token** | string | Secure oAuth token
app_state | string | URL Encoded application state
public_token | string | Public oAuth token for Ecwid REST API
view_mode | string | Mode used to display the application interface: in a `POPUP` or in a `PAGE`. `PAGE` is a default mode when app is displayed in a separate tab in Ecwid Control Panel

<aside class="note">Fields marked in <strong>bold</strong> are always sent in the payload. Others are sent depending on conditions.</aside>

### openPage

> Open some page inside Control Panel from your application

```js
EcwidApp.openPage('products');
```

The `EcwidApp.openPage()` method allows you to direct the user to some particular page in the Control Panel

To open a page in Ecwid CP, you will need to get its identification after the hash (#) part in the URL. 

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
page | string | Hash part of of the page URL in the Control Panel. Examples: `billing` will open the Billing page, `products` will open the Catalog page.

**Examples**: 

1) Open Catalog page 

Target URL: `https://my.ecwid.com/store/1003#products`
What we need use: `products`

The result: `EcwidApp.openPage('products');`

2) Open specific order details page

Target URL: `https://my.ecwid.com/store/5035009#order:id=938&return=orders`
What we need to use: `order:id=938&return=orders`

The result: `EcwidApp.openPage('order:id=938&return=orders');`

### ready

> Show app UI when your app is ready to show it

```js
// Initialize the application
EcwidApp.init({
  app_id: "my-super-app", // use your application client_id
  autoloadedflag: false, 
  autoheight: true
});

// Show app UI
EcwidApp.ready();
```

You can use the `EcwidApp.ready()` method in your application to inform Ecwid of ready state of your application. 

For example, you may need to make a few API calls or load some additional assets before your app UI should be displayed to the user. In this way, pass `false` in the `autoloadedflag` parameter in the [`EcwidApp.init()`](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/ecwid-javascript-sdk#init) method and call the `.ready()` function when you are ready. 


### setSize

> Set your app iframe size from within the app

```js
EcwidApp.setSize({height: 800});
```

We recommend using the `autoheight` parameter set as `true` in [`EcwidApp.init()`](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/ecwid-javascript-sdk#init) function to let Ecwid dynamically adjust your app iframe size depending on your application content size. But if you want to control the iframe size yourself, set that flag as `false` and use this `EcwidApp.setSize()` method.


#### Parameters

The only parameter is a JSON object with the `height` field:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
height | number | The iframe height in pixels

### setAppStorage

> Save multiple 'key' : 'value' data to app storage

```js
var data = { 
  color : 'red',

> Get app public config in your native app

```js
var publicConfig;

EcwidApp.getAppStorage('public', function(value){
  console.log(value);
  // '{ "color" : "red", "page_id" : "123456" }'

  publicConfig = value;
})

publicConfig = JSON.parse(publicConfig);

console.log(publicConfig.color);
// 'red'
```

### closeAppPopup

```js
EcwidApp.closeAppPopup();
```

When a native application is opened in a popup window in Ecwid Control Panel, executing this function will close that popup for the user.

In case when application is opened in a tab, nothing will happen. 

### sendUserToUpgrade

> Send user to upgrade usage

```
EcwidApp.sendUserToUpgrade(features);
```

> Send user to upgrade examples

```js
// Send user to upgrade to get Product Variations feature
EcwidApp.sendUserToUpgrade(["COMBINATIONS"]);

// Send user to upgrade to the minimal plan where Order Editor and Marketplaces features are available
EcwidApp.sendUserToUpgrade(["ORDER_EDITOR", "MARKETPLACES"]);

```

Ecwid JS SDK allows your app interface to initiate the upgrade process for a user. The upgrade process is launched using the `EcwidApp.sendUserToUpgrade()` function, where you should provide the feature to upgrade to.

When you pass `features` array as argument, Ecwid will determine the minimum required plan for merchant to use them and initiate upgrade process

Features list is available in the [Store profile endpoint](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/store-information#get-store-profile) of Ecwid REST API. [Contact Ecwid team](/contact) to find out the feature name if it's missing in your store.

## Troubleshooting

#### A new tab inside Ecwid Control Panel is not appearing
You created an app and installed it on your test store, but the new tab is not appearing when you open your store. There are several possible reasons:

* **The application is not configured properly** to be displayed inside Control Panel. E.g. during registration, you forgot to mention that your app will embed itself into Control Panel, or did not choose exact section inside Control Panel where Ecwid needs to display your app. See ["Set up your application"](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/building-a-native-app#set-up-your-application) for the details.
* **You didn't include the `add_to_cp` access scope** to the list of requested scopes while authorizing the app. While creating an oauth URL, make sure it incudes the "add_to_cp" scope in the list of requested permissions. 
* **You're testing it in an Ecwid store which is on Free plan**. Ecwid API functionality including embedding apps is available on paid Ecwid plans only. Please upgrade your account.

#### The application tab appears in Ecwid Control Panel, but it doesn't load the app content
You created an app and installed it on your test store. The new tab appears in your Control Panel but the new tab content is not loaded and displaing the "Something went wrong" error message instead. Possible reasons:

* **Ecwid cannot reach the iframe URL** that you set up for your application either because it's unavailable or because it has restricted access.
* **The URL for the app was not set**. If you just recently registered your app, the iframe URL is not set for it yet. Thus, you can see an error when trying to open the app tab in your Ecwid Control Panel. [Contact us](/contact) and provide the URL for your app to fix this.
* **Browser blocks the document in iframe** because it loads over HTTP while the Control Panel is working over HTTPS (the ["mixed content"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent) issue). Please make sure you set an HTTPS URL as the iframe URL in the app settings.
* **Ecwid Control Panel is restricted to load your app in iframe** because your app server responds with the "SAMEORIGIN" value in [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/X-Frame-Options) header. 
* **The application in the tab is not initialized**. Make sure you initialized the app with the proper namespace using the .init() method of [Ecwid JS SDK](#ecwid-javascript-sdk). 
* **The iframe URL performs a redirect**. When loading application in Ecwid Control Panel, Ecwid checks for the iframe page to have the same address as specified in the application. Make sure that your page initializes the app before making a redirect.
