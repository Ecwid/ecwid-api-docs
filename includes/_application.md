#### What is Ecwid billing and how do I use it? 

Ecwid billing is a feature that allows to accept payments for applications. It works out of the box, so no additional development is required to use it. 

You can specify free trial period for new installs and active users pay on a monthly basis. To find out more details and how to use it, please visit: [http://developers.ecwid.com/make-money](http://developers.ecwid.com/make-money)
