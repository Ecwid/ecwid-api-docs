# Add Custom Discount

With the Custom Discount API you can apply custom discounts to the order total when the customer is at the checkout.

Access scope required: <strong>customize_cart_calculation</strong> (see <a href="#access-scopes">Access scopes</a>)
</aside>

#### Discount types examples

The Custom Discount API allows you to apply an absolute or percent discount to an order. While this sounds simple enough, it provides many possibilities and different ways to use it in a store.

Examples:

- **Customer loyalty**: when a customer from a VIP customer group is at the checkout, apply 5% discount.
- **Limited-time offers**: enable or disable discounts based on a current date.
- **Apply discount to select products**: when a customer adds a product from the sale category, apply 3% discount.
- **Local customer discount**: if the customer’s location is in the same city as the store, apply a local discount of $5.
- **Buy one, get one free (BOGOF)**: when the customer puts a specific product in their cart, the app adds a new free product with the JS API. The app applies an absolute discount for the cost amount of that free product.
- And many more!


## How custom discount works

#### 1. Ecwid sends cart data to app request URL

The request to your app URL can be triggered by a customer in storefront or by an API request to order details calculation [endpoint](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/carts#calculate-order-details). 

To apply new discounts for a cart in storefront, Ecwid will send a **POST request** to your endpoint with cart details: items, customer address, merchant app settings, etc.

For all of the cases below, your application should provide correct discount calculations for the total of cart information available to the application.

**Customer in storefront**

The request will be sent when the customer's cart changes - a new product is added to cart, shipping address is changed, cart initialized, a product was added to a cart, a product removed from cart, the product’s options changed on cart page, cart was cleared, a discount coupon applied, selected shipping method changed, cart contents are synced, if there are a few browser tabs with the store are opened, etc.

**Calculate order details API сall**

The products and cart information itself can be different from what the store actually has. For example, some other application can create a custom storefront where it requests order calculation with items that are not present in the store. 

#### 2. Application returns discounts in a specific format

Ecwid will expect **a response to its request** from your service within **5 second interval** to display additional discounts for an order. In the response, provide discount value, type of discount (percent or absolute) and discount description. See the response format in the [Request and response](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/request-for-discount-and-response) section.

<aside class="notice">
Please mind that the response isn't a separate request back to a specific URL in Ecwid. This needs to be a response to the request Ecwid makes to the application URL.
</aside>

#### 3. Ecwid displays discounts at checkout

Based on the response from your app, Ecwid will display the discounts for customers on the cart page. Customer can view the amount and the reason for a discount that your solution sent to Ecwid. All the discount details will be saved for that order and they will be displayed in related order information.

#### Q: In what order does Ecwid calculate the order total?

Ecwid calculates the order total in this order: 

1. Order subtotal
2. Coupon discount
3. Handling fee
4. Discounts (app discounts too)
5. Shipping
6. Taxes

Please keep this in mind when creating an app for Ecwid.

#### Q: What happens, if my URL responds with an error? 

In case if your app responds with an error or in an incorrect format, then the discounts from your app will not be shown to customer at checkout stage and they will be able to shop in the store as usual. If your store has applicable discounts methods set up using the default means of creating discounts in Ecwid, then they will be shown to customer and applied to order.

#### Q: Can I create a user interface for user to select and set different duscount rules?

After the installation, your app can add a page where they can configure it: provide their account details, set up discount rules, enable/disable rules, etc. We recommend using **Native apps** feature and the **Application storage** feature to provide this functionality. To manage and store those settings, see the [Advanced setup](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/user-interface-for-discount-rules) section.

## Set up custom discount

When [registering a new application](/register) for Ecwid, specify the request URL for your application. Ecwid will be sending cart details requests to that endpoint and expect discounts in a specific format in response.

## Request for discount and response

Ecwid will send the cart details in a **body** of POST HTTP request in the following format:

## User interface for discount rules

You can create a user interface for merchants to specify their own promo rule combinations or any other user preferences you may require for your app. 

We recommend adding a new tab into the Ecwid Control Panel's promotion section for optimal experience using the: [Native applications](#native-applications) feature and [Application storage](#application-storage) features.

**Settings and User interface**

First, set up a new tab in Ecwid Control Panel, which will serve as a settings page for your users. This tab will load a page from your server in an iframe in a separate tab of Ecwid Control Panel. See [Native Applications](#native-applications) for more info.

**Request**

Once the settings are saved there, Ecwid will send them in a **POST request** to your application alongside cart details when customer is at checkout stage. The request will contain **all data** from your application storage, including public and other keys that were saved by the app. Use it to idetify the store and apply discounts accordingly. See [Application storage](#application-storage) for more info.

**Response**

After you get a request from Ecwid, your application endpoint should get its components and return discounts back to the customer in a response.
