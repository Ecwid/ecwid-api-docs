# Add Shipping Method

Using the Custom Shipping API, you can integrate a new shipping carrier to provide real-time shipping methods with different rates for the Ecwid store customers. This functionality will work in the form of an application that users install from the Ecwid App Market.

<aside class="notice">
Access scope required: <strong>add_shipping_method</strong> (see <a href="#access-scopes">Access scopes</a>)
</aside>

## How shipping method works

#### 1. User configures app settings in settings tab

After the installation, user would need a page where they can configure it: provide their account details, set up dimensions, etc. We recommend using [Native apps feature](#embedded-apps) to provide this functionality. To manage and store those settings, see the [Merchant app settings](#merchant-settings-for-shipping-method) section.

#### 2. Ecwid sends order data to app request URL

The request to your app URL can be triggered by a customer in storefront or by an API request to order details calculation [endpoint](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/carts#calculate-order-details).

To show new shipping methods in storefront, Ecwid will send a **POST request** to your endpoint with order details: items, customer address, merchant app settings, etc. That endpoint must respond to the request with the shipping rates for this configuration.

In the case of an API request for calculating order details, the products and cart information itself can be different from what the store has. For example, some other application can create a custom storefront where it requests order calculation with items that are not present in the store. For these cases, your application should also provide correct discount calculations for the amount of cart information available.

#### 3. Application returns the rates in a specific format

Ecwid will expect a response from your service within 10 second interval to display additional shipping methods for customers. In the response, provide shipping method name, rate and estimated delivery time. See the response format in the [Request and response](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/shipping-request-and-response) section.

#### 4. Ecwid displays the rates at checkout

Based on the response from your app, Ecwid will display the shipping methods for customers at the checkout. Customer can select them just like any other shipping method in that Ecwid store and it will be shown in the order details. Shipping methods from the application will be added to any currently enabled shipping methods a store has enabled.

#### Q: What happens, if my URL responds with an error? 

In case if your app responds with an error or in an incorrect format, then the shipping methods from your app will not be shown to customer at checkout stage. If your store has applicable shipping methods set up using the default means of creating shipping methods in Ecwid, then they will be shown to customer.

## Set up shipping method

When [registering a new application](/register) for Ecwid, specify the **request URL** for your application. Ecwid will be sending order details requests to that endpoint and expect shipping rates in a specific format in response.

<aside class='notice'>
If your application is for public use, the request URL must be working <strong>via HTTPS</strong>. Also, the certificate can only be from <strong>trusted CA's and not self-signed</strong>.
</aside>

## Merchant settings for shipping method

Your application can require merchants to specify their shipping account details, package size and any other user preferences you may require. We recommend adding a new tab into the Ecwid Control Panel's Shipping settings for optimal experience - Native applications feature.

> Merchant settings example

> ![Merchant settings example](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/shippingSettings-1468407629.png)

**Settings**

First, set up a new tab in Ecwid Control Panel, which will serve as a settings page for your users. This tab will load a page from your server in an iframe in a separate tab of Ecwid Control Panel. See [Native Applications](#native-applications).

When merchant is in the settings tab of your app, your code can create and modify the merchant settings using the **Application storage** feature. It's a simple `key:value` storage, which can serve you as an app database. For your convenience, you can access it [via Javascript](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/storage-in-ecwid-api#javascript-storage-api) (client-side) or [Ecwid REST API](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/storage-in-ecwid-api#rest-storage-api) (server-side).

**Request**

Once the settings are saved there, Ecwid will send them in a **POST request** to your application alongside order details when customer is at checkout stage. The request will contain **all data** from your application storage, including public and other keys that were specified. Use it to idetify the store and a user for the shipping rates.

You can also use the `public` key of the application storage to save data for accessing in the storefront. More details on how to handle such data: [Public application config](#public-application-config).

Please make sure **not to pass any sensitive user data in the public application config**, as this information will be available via Ecwid Javascript API to any 3-rd party. To save and get that kind of information, use any other key names in your application storage. They will be provided in a request to your application as well as public information, but not accessible in the storefront.

**Response**

After you get a request from Ecwid, your application endpoint should get its components and return correct rates back to the customer in a response.

## Shipping request and response

### Request

Ecwid will send order information in the **body** of a POST HTTP request in the following format:

### Weight units

Ecwid supports several weigh units that can be passed in the request to your application to provide shipping rates. Below you can see all available units as well as their conversion values for calculation. 

Name | Code | Value
-----|------|------
Carat | carat | 0.2
Gram | gram | 1
Ounce | ounce | 28.35
Pound | lbs | 453.6
Kilogram | kg | 1000

Gram is the main weight unit, from which other units are converted. Merchants can change weight units in [Ecwid Control Panel](https://my.ecwid.com/cp/CP.html#formats-units).

## Troubleshooting shipping

#### A new shipping method at checkout is not appearing

You created an app and installed it on your test store, but a new shipping method, returned by your resource, is not appearing when you open your store. There are several possible reasons for this:

* **The application is not configured properly** to add a shipping method at checkout. E.g. during registration, you haven't provided a link for Ecwid to send the requests to when customer is at checkout or the URL is incorrect. See [How to set uo](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/set-up-shipping-method) for the details.
* **`add_shipping_method` access scope** is missing in the list of requested scopes while installing the app. While creating an oAuth URL or installing your app from an app details page, make sure it incudes the `add_to_cp` scope in the list of requested permissions. 
* **The response format from your resource is incorrect**. Ecwid accepts response from shipping applications in [a strict format](https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/shipping-request-and-response), so please make sure your endpoint is responding correctly back to Ecwid with the correct shipping methods. 
* **The response from your resource has exceeded 10 second timeout**. When Ecwid sends a request for additional shipping methods to external resources, it expects to get a response within the 10 second timeout period. Make sure that your service is able to provide response in that time period.
* **You're testing it in an Ecwid store which is on Free plan**. Ecwid API functionality is available on paid Ecwid plans only. Please upgrade your account or [contact us](/contact).
