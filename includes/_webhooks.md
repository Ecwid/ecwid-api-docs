# Webhooks[coming soon]
Ecwid can notify another application about important store events as they happen in near real-time.  

A developer can use webhooks to extend and customize the checkout process of Ecwid stores. For example send a custom e-mail notification, inform your supplier about a sale, generate a pin code or a license key for a sold software, send a text message, add a new order to your accounting software or subscribe a new customer to your newsletter.

## How it works

All you have to do is provide a URL and Ecwid will call this URL (via HTTP POST request) as soon as things happen.

The following events are supported:

* New order has been placed
* Order status has been changed
* Order has been deleted
* New product has been created
* Product has been updated
* Product has been deleted

Any Ecwid application has a set of access scopes that it can use for requests in Ecwdi API. So in terms of the access scopes, webhooks work like this: 
- Access token A has access to store's catalog and orders: Ecwid will send webhooks for any event in store's products or orders
- Access token B has access to store's catalog: Ecwid will send webhooks for any event in store's products only
- Access token C has access to store's orders: Ecwid will send webhooks for any event in store's orders only

## How to configure

When you are [registering your application](#register-your-app-in-ecwid) you will need to specify a single URL where Ecwid will send the updates about the events in the store. 

### Response

> Response example (JSON)

```json
{
	"eventId": 12345,
	"eventType": "product.updated",
	"eventCreated": 1230329329,
	"storeId": 1003,
	"entityId": 130030039,
}
```

The following parameters are sent in an HTTP POST request to the endpoint URL as soon as one of the supported events occurs: 

Name | Type    | Description
---- | ------- | --------------
eventId | number | unique webhook ID
eventType | string | Type of the occurred event. Possible values: **order.created** or **product.updated**. Ecwid sends the eventType as a URL parameter, for example: https://www.app.com/callback?eventtype=product.created so your endpoint can only listen for specific type of events
eventCreated | Unix Timestamp | Unix timestamp of the occurred event.
storeId | number | Store ID of the store where the event occured.
entityId | number | Id of the entity, where the event occured. For example, if a product was updated, then the entityId will be the ID of that product


If the request fails to connect (wrong URL or problems on your server) in the time span of 30 seconds, Ecwid will attempt to re-send it every 15 minutes. If all attempts were not successful, a message gets removed from the queue as an undelivered one.

The request is considered successful if an endpoint/URL returns HTTP 200 or HTTP 201 status header. 

## Securing Webhooks and correct workflow

The correct workflow is as follows: 

- Your script gets a notification about an event. Only the necessary information like order number, date and store ID is sent. Ecwid will not send any private and sensitive information.
- Then your script should use the [Orders API endpoint](#orders) or [Product API endpoint](#products) to validate and get more information about this event. I.e. check that the placed/updated order exists and gets necessary sensitive order details. If no such order exists in a database or it exists, but its current order status doesn't match a status in the notification, then the notification should be ignored as a fake one. 

This approach makes the whole process to be secure by design. For example:

1) If you set the incorrect endpoint URL or use a 3d-party URL to test notifications, they will not get a private information about your customers, because they don't know your API access token.

2) This design forces a developer to always verify each notification request which comes to the endpoint. So even if somebody tries to "fake" a notification, it will not be validated and will be ignored.

## How to test

For testing notifications you will need to make some changes in your store, i.e. create a new order or change a product. 

Also we suggest to use the [RequestBin tool](http://requestb.in/). It is an awesome utility to help see data come across as events happen in your system. Make a new bin and use its URL as the endpoint one. All notifications will appear in the same RequestBin page. ï‚œ
